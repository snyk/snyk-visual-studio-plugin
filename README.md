# Visual Studio extension

The Snyk Visual Studio extension provides analysis of your code and open-source dependencies. Download the plugin at any time free of charge and use it with any Snyk account. Scan your code early in the development lifecycle to help you pass security reviews and avoid costly fixes later in the development cycle.

Snyk scans for vulnerabilities and returns results with security issues categorized by issue type and severity.

For open source, you receive automated algorithm-based fix suggestions for both direct and transitive dependencies.

This single plugin provides a Java vulnerability scanner, a custom code vulnerability scanner, and an open-source security scanner.

Snyk scans for the following types of issues:

* [**Open Source Security**](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/) - security vulnerabilities and license issues in both direct and indirect (transitive) open-source dependencies pulled into the Snyk Project.\
  See also the [Open Source docs](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source).
* [**Code Security and Code Quality**](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/) - security vulnerabilities and quality issues in your code. See also the Snyk Code docs.\
  See also the [Snyk Code docs](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code).

In using the Visual Studio Code extension, you have the advantage of relying on the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://docs.snyk.io/introducing-snyk/getting-started-snyk-intel-vuln-db-access). You also have available the [Snyk Code AI Engine](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/introducing-snyk-code/key-features/ai-engine).
